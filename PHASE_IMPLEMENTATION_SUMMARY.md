volatility = BayesianTradingFramework.advanced_bayesian_volatility(prices)
# Returns: Full posterior distribution with diagnostics

# Professional options pricing
option_result = QuantLibFinancialEngineering.black_scholes_option_pricing(...)
# Returns: Price + full Greeks calculation

# Modern portfolio optimization
portfolio = AdvancedPortfolioOptimization.black_litterman_optimization(...)
# Returns: Optimal weights with uncertainty bands

# GARCH volatility modeling
